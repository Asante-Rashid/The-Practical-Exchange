# The-Practical-Exchange:

Your project should fulfill the following requirements:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two server-side APIs.

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

<!-- * Use client-side storage to store persistent data. -->

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

# The Project:

User Story: As a frugal collector, I want an app that will find rare, fascinating and  FREE items in my area. I would also like for it to find items in a given city so that if I'm traveling I can continue to expand my collection. This app also has to be easy to use, very user friendly.

Our project was created on the basis of a barter exchange application that allows the user to search items in a particular city and find them using a site called trash nothing. The site allows other people who are trying to get rid of items that are no longer needed and post it to the website. The user can go into the application and search a city and see the posts also the embedded map gives the user the ability to see the general area of the post to know how far they would have to travel to pick up the item. As stated above as a group we were to use a CSS framework other than bootstrap so we used Bulma. Bulma is a free, open source framework that provides ready-to-use frontend components that you can easily combine to build responsive web interfaces. The site is deployed to GitHub Pages and has a working URL that each group member tested individually. As stated above two server side API's were needed to fulfill the requirements the two we chose are open weather geolocation with Google maps(the emebedded map the user can also click on to enlarge) and Trash Nothing (this is the one displaying the posts and the image if one is provided). The application is responsive in the fact when the previous and next buttons are pushed the post is moved to the next one, th image is updated, and the map location is updated as well all work simultaneously. The UI is also polished and represents the trash nothing theme of recycling and passing on someone's unused items to the benefit of another. The repository is clean and organized with folders containing assets, images for the webpage, and also screenshots so anyone looking into the details can see the progression of the application from the starting framework to the final ending deployed user interface. In meeting the requirements above the unique name, description, and technologies used are stated above and the screenshot, link to deployed application will be below. 

# Lessons:

Our project taught us a lot of great things with not only how to work with creating an application but doing it as a group. Each person had their own abilities and strengths so we broke the work up based on this. Asante and Anthony were doing the front end web development where Kimo and Jesus were in charge of the backend web development. The tasks were quite evenly tackled by each group member and when bugs arose we would work through them as either front end web development or back end web development respectively. When pushing to github as a group this was a valuable lesson to learn since we were all working on different parts of the application and yes we did have merge conflicts. The way we worked through these merges that caused conflicts was we never did any merging without all being present to figure out which code was needed and which was unnecessary. This allowed our code to develop as a group and form a working application that we all contributed a lot of time and effort. Huge lesson learned during this project was working as a team with a definitive goal in mind for our finished application. 

# Takeaways:

Our takeaways from this project were endless in the front end web development team had to use an entire new CSS framework Bulma and it has its own abilities but also challenges. When in development one person was sharing the screen and typing or making small changes to check the code and what it did while the other read the documentation for Bulma so we could fully understand how and why the changes we made were affecting the visual we would see on the page. Each team member took part in both activities of either screen sharing or documentation research. For the back end web development team each person took on a certain tasks and developed that particular piece as needed i.e. getting the picture to appear, having the description appear on the page, allowing them to be controlled by the buttons on the page, etc. We all seemed to work well as a group to complete the necessary tasks. As a group we all took a lot from this project and now have a working application that we can add to our portfolios for potential employers.
